# WATER-QUALITY-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Water, functioning as a nearly universal solvent, has the ability to dissolve various compounds 
based on their polarity. This includes both polar and nonpolar compounds, even at extremely 
low concentrations. However, these seemingly invisible and tasteless contaminants in water 
can pose health risks for consumers. To address this, a comprehensive understanding of water 
quality is crucial for informed decisions on protection and management. Horton introduced the 
concept of the Water Quality Index (WQI)[1], providing a numerical representation for 
assessing water quality in specific locations.
This tool is widely used by environmental scientists, water resource managers, and 
policymakers to communicate water quality information effectively to the public. The 
assessment of water quality relies on various physical and chemical parameters associated with 
its intended use, and establishing acceptable values for each parameter is essential. If water 
fails to meet these standards, treatment is necessary before utilization. The project aims to 
leverage machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random 
Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and 
AdaBoost, for assessing water quality.
Using a dataset with parameters such as Trihalomethanes, pH, Solids, Chloramines, Sulphate, 
Hardness, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, and Turbidity from various water bodies, the study 
successfully predicts water potability with near accuracy
